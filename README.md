# **Let's Go for a movie - backend repository**

## **Overview**

This repository contains the backend-code for the project "go-for-a-movie" , a sample web application, where users can browse a list of movies by genres, which come with some statistics as rating, runtime... in order to find the perfect movie they need.

I'm aware that it is a "useless" project on the web, because of the rise of Streaming platform.
But still, the main goal was to practice CRUD functionality with a backend built in [Golang](https://go.dev/).

## **Installation**

### **Technical Requirements**

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your system (to run the docker container used for database storage).
- Go ( > 1.20 ) , steps of installation [here](https://go.dev/dl/)

### **Step-by-step**

-> First thing first, you can git-clone this repository simply by entering in your terminal

```
git clone
```

-> Then in the root folder of `go-movies-backend` launch this command:

```
docker compose up
```

The `docker-compose.yml` defines a PostgreSQL service with the specified configuration options, making it easy to deploy and manage a PostgreSQL database using Docker.

-> In another terminal, still in the root folder of `go-movies-backend` run command

```
go run ./cmd/api/
```

You should get this message in your terminal

```
2024/05/15 09:44:11 Connected to postgres!
2024/05/15 09:44:11 Starting application on Port:  8080
```

Your backend is now completly set up and ready to serve resources ! <br>

- You can also install [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) or [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) to get a visual representation of your database (generated by the docker-compose.yaml file) <br>
- Alternatively making a request to `http://localhost:8080/movies` will show you a list of all movies in raw JSON, currently registered in database
